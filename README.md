# FreeCodeCamp-JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
A repository to hold my FreeCodeCamp 'JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures' projects and certificate.

Each project has been hosted on GitHub pages as a simple interactive and responsive webpage made up of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, so the user can test the code as well as read it.

GitHub Pages Link (for my reference): https://jake2020.github.io/FreeCodeCamp-JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/

## The following projects/coding challenges were completed to gain this certification:

1. [Palindrome Checker](https://jake2020.github.io/FreeCodeCamp-JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/PalindromeChecker.html)
2. Roman Numeral Converter
3. [Caesars Cipher](https://jake2020.github.io/FreeCodeCamp-JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/CaesarsCipher.html)
4. Telephone Number Validator
5. Cash Register

## Project 1: [Palindrome Checker](https://jake2020.github.io/FreeCodeCamp-JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/PalindromeChecker.html)
*Note: Example text is provided but any input can be checked*

Problem Description:

Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.
A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.
Note: You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.
We'll pass strings with varying formats, such as racecar, RaceCar, and race CAR among others.
We'll also pass strings with special symbols, such as 2A3*3a2, 2A3 3a2, and 2_A3*3#A2.

Expected Outputs:

- palindrome("eye") should return a boolean.
- Waiting:palindrome("eye") should return true.
- Waiting:palindrome("_eye") should return true.
- Waiting:palindrome("race car") should return true.
- Waiting:palindrome("not a palindrome") should return false.
- Waiting:palindrome("A man, a plan, a canal. Panama") should return true.
- Waiting:palindrome("never odd or even") should return true.
- Waiting:palindrome("nope") should return false.
- Waiting:palindrome("almostomla") should return false.
- Waiting:palindrome("My age is 0, 0 si ega ym.") should return true.
- Waiting:palindrome("1 eye for of 1 eye.") should return false.
- Waiting:palindrome("0_0 (: /-\ :) 0-0") should return true.
- Waiting:palindrome("five|\_/|four") should return false.

## Project 2: Coming soon

## Project 3: [Caesars Cipher](https://jake2020.github.io/FreeCodeCamp-JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/CaesarsCipher.html)
*Note: 3 exaples ciphers are included to decode but the user can use any input text. Might add encoding later but this was not part of the project requirements*
*Note: If using your own inputs the program only convers UPPERCASE charachters*

Problem Description:

One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.
A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus A ↔ N, B ↔ O and so on.
Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.
All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.

Expected Outputs:

- rot13("SERR PBQR PNZC") should decode to the string FREE CODE CAMP
- Waiting:rot13("SERR CVMMN!") should decode to the string FREE PIZZA!
- Waiting:rot13("SERR YBIR?") should decode to the string FREE LOVE?
- Waiting:rot13("GUR DHVPX OEBJA SBK WHZCF BIRE GUR YNML QBT.") should decode to the string THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG.
