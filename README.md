# FreeCodeCamp-JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
Repository to hold my FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures projects and certificate

GitHub Pages Link (for my reference): https://jake2020.github.io/FreeCodeCamp-JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/

## The following projects/coding challenges were completed to gain this certification:

1. Palindrome Checker
2. Roman Numeral Converter
3. [Caesars Cipher](https://jake2020.github.io/FreeCodeCamp-JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/CaesarsCipher.html)
4. Telephone Number Validator
5. Cash Register

## Project 1: Coming soon

## Project 2: Coming soon

## Project 3: [Caesars Cipher](https://jake2020.github.io/FreeCodeCamp-JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/CaesarsCipher.html)
A simple webpage to host the JavaScript code I submitted for this project and to allow the user to interact with it for demonstration purposes.

*Note: 3 exaples ciphers are included to decode but the user can use any input text. Might add encoding later but this was not part of the project requirements*

Problem Description:

One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.
A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus A ↔ N, B ↔ O and so on.
Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.
All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.

Expected Outputs:

- rot13("SERR PBQR PNZC") should decode to the string FREE CODE CAMP
- Waiting:rot13("SERR CVMMN!") should decode to the string FREE PIZZA!
- Waiting:rot13("SERR YBIR?") should decode to the string FREE LOVE?
- Waiting:rot13("GUR DHVPX OEBJA SBK WHZCF BIRE GUR YNML QBT.") should decode to the string THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG.
